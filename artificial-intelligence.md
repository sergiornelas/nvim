## Cursor IDE

### Avante vs Cursor IDE

- `Me`: Do you think there will be a point where avante.nvim matches the
        features that Cursor IDE offers?
- `A guy`: It’s getting damn close. But it requires a quite a bit of
           post-install configuration to get it "damn close".
- `Me`: What kind of post-installation configuration is needed?
- `A guy`:

## MCP

Make sure you integrate the `MCPHub plugin` into `Avante` and install the
`memory` and `sequentialthinkng` MCP servers. It’s really quite incredible
the quality of code that Avante can generate with this `MCPHub` plugin.

- Yetone:
mcphub.nvim's approach to installing MCP server is incredibly clever. It
directly calls avante.nvim itself to automatically install and configure MCP
server using its built-in tools. Users don't need to face any forms, manually
input anything, or edit JSON - they just need to keep deciding yes or no. It's
so elegant that it even outperforms all GUI MCP clients! I mean, completely
outperforms!

## Aider

<https://aider.chat/>              check this, it's the best competitor vs cursor IDE
GeorgesAlkhouri/nvim-aider                     seamlessly integrate Aider with Neovim

No need for a plugin imo. aider —watch-files in a separate terminal works pretty
well.
